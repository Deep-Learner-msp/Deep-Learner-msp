ðŸ‘‹ Greetings, I am MSP Raja, an accomplished data science and AI professional with more than 5 years of industry experience. I currently lead a brilliant team of data scientists and engineers at a financial firm, harnessing the power of AI to create transformative solutions.

ðŸ”¬ As a passionate researcher, I've authored 4 research papers in the realm of speech recognition and natural language processing, presented at prestigious conferences such as EMNLP and FNP. One of my highlights includes presenting my work at the EMNLP conference held in Abu Dhabi in December 2022.

ðŸ’¼ Beyond the financial industry, my experience spans developing AI for search engines and cybersecurity defense systems. My skill set covers a broad spectrum of AI techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, enabling me to leverage AI in solving complex real-world problems.

ðŸ§  Currently, I am delving into Defi and large language models, with a futuristic vision of creating machines that can emulate the human brain's functionality, potentially probing into the realm of machine consciousness.

ðŸ‘¥ I also find immense joy in imparting my knowledge, serving as an instructor for aspiring learners in data science and AI. My industry experience and research expertise allow me to provide valuable insights and practical examples that enhance students' understanding and application of AI concepts.

ðŸ’¡ I am eager to collaborate on non-profit AI projects aimed at crafting a better world. If our paths align, I am more than open to connect and collaborate!
